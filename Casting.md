📌 What is Type Casting?
Type casting in Java is the process of converting one data type into another. It helps us use values in compatible operations, especially when we deal with multiple data types in calculations or assignments.

🔷 Types of Type Casting:
✅ 1. Widening Casting (Implicit)
Converts a smaller type to a larger type size.

Done automatically by Java.

No data loss occurs.

🔁 Conversion Order:
byte → short → int → long → float → double



⚠️ 2. Narrowing Casting (Explicit)
Converts a larger type to a smaller type size.

Must be manually done using cast syntax.

Data loss or truncation may occur.
