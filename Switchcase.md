# Switch Case in Java

## ðŸ“˜ Description

The `switch` statement in Java is a type of control statement that allows a variable to be tested for equality against multiple values. It is an alternative to using many `if-else-if` statements and is generally cleaner and more readable for multiple conditions based on a single variable.

}
